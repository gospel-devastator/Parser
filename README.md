# Parser
The parser application is necessary to extract prices from specified sites.
Before starting the scan, which is carried out from the menu button at the top of the form, 
you need to fill in data about the sites from which prices will be retrieved, as well as product names. 
Attention, the names of goods are register-insensitive.
